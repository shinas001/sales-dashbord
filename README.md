In this project, I created an interactive dashboard to analyze sales data from January 2024. The data includes information on sales revenue, quantity sold, and regions for different products.

Data
The dataset includes the following fields:

Date: The date of the sale.
Product: The product sold (Product A, Product B, Product C, Product D).
Sales: The sales revenue for each entry.
Quantity: The number of units sold.
Region: The region where the sale occurred (North, East, West).
